Introduction
*******************

This document is the Software User Manual (SUM) for the Test and 
Simulation Toolkit (TSTK). This SUM will explain the possibilities of 
the TSTK and how to use it. This manual is intended for both InTraffic 
employees and developers from the open source community. 

This manual can contain some basic explanation about Git(hub) workflow 
and/or procedures. The reason behind this is because not everyone might 
be familliar with them.
